Dear HR Manager:</br>

This letter is to express my interest in your posting on seek.co.nz for an experienced Software Developer. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, hands-on experience using iOS(Objective-C, swift), frontend(css3, js, html5, scss, etc.), LNMP(PHP, etc.) languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your company.</br>

I enjoy being challenged and working on projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your company.</br>

I've attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development and spent few days building a resume website online.(<a href="http://wfxiaolong.github.io/resume/index.html">http://wfxiaolong.github.io/resume/index.html</a>)</br>

Once offer is received, I will be able to start working within a month. I can be reached anytime via my Email(horton.lin3@gmail.com) or cell phone(02108370117).</br>

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.</br>

Sincerely,

Horton
